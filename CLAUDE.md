# SubSub

## What this is, and what it is not

SubSub is for **running the subcontractors you already have**, and for
**adding the ones you meet in person**. A general contractor gets a roster
they control, documents that stay current, availability they can see, and a
QR code they hand to somebody on a job site.

**It is not a discovery engine, a directory, or a marketplace.** Nobody comes
here to browse for a roofer. There is no "find contractors near me", no
ranked list of companies a stranger can page through, and no feature that
answers "who is on SubSub?".

This is a product decision, not a missing feature. Read it as a standing
constraint on everything built here.

## The rule that follows from it

**No account may mine another account's subcontractors.**

Contractor names, contacts, phone numbers, addresses, documents, crews,
availability, rates and job history belong to the contractor and to the
accounts they have chosen to work with. Nothing built here may let anybody
else accumulate them.

Concretely, when adding or changing anything that reads the `companies`
table or anything hanging off it:

- **Scope to the caller's own engagements by default.** A query that reads
  company data and does not join `engagements` on the caller's `account_id`
  needs a specific reason, written down next to it.

- **Whole values only, never prefixes.** The connect lookup matches a
  complete email, a complete mobile or a complete licence number. No `LIKE`,
  no partial match, no "starts with", no fuzzy search across the table.
  A prefix search is a directory somebody can walk one letter at a time.

- **Answer the question, do not describe the company.** A lookup exists so
  you do not invite somebody who already has an account. It returns which
  company it is, so you ask the right one to connect — not their staff's
  names, not their licence number, not anything a caller with no
  relationship to them has a reason to hold.

- **Name matching is local only.** Matching a typed company name against the
  account's *own* contractors and its *own* outstanding invites is fine:
  that is its own data. Sending a name to the server to be matched across
  every company is not, and there is no endpoint that does it.

- **Rate-limit every lookup, per account.** Even whole-value matching is a
  confirm-and-enrich oracle for somebody holding a list of addresses.

- **A person's photograph is not a company logo.** Logos are public because
  they render on a login page. Avatars, documents and anything else about a
  person sit behind auth and behind a shared-account check.

- **Staff routes are staff routes.** `/api/platform/*` may read across every
  account because SubSub's own console needs to. It is gated by
  `requireStaff`. Never reach for one of those queries to serve a customer
  screen.

If a request seems to want a directory — "search all contractors", "show
similar companies nearby", "suggest subs for this trade" — stop and say so
before building it. It may still be the right thing to build, but it changes
what this product is and needs a decision, not an implementation.

## Working here

- The app is `app/` (Vite + React, one large `App.tsx`), the API is
  `app/worker/index.js` (Hono on Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2), and the
  marketing site is at the repo root.
- Migrations are applied **by hand** in the D1 console, in order. Every one
  that adds a column or table gets a line in
  `app/worker/migrations/CHECK.sql`, which answers "did I run that one?"
  against the schema itself.
- D1 stops a multi-statement script at the first failing statement and does
  not undo what ran before it. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` is the statement
  that is not repeatable, so it goes in a paste of its own.
- Tests live in `app/scripts/*-test.mjs` and are registered in
  `package.json`. The ones ending in a browser harness build the real bundle
  and stub the API (`scripts/lib/stub-stack.mjs`) — no worker, no database.
- Before claiming a fix works, revert it and confirm the test fails.
