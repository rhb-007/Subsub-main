# SubSub

## What this is, and what it is not

SubSub is for **running the subcontractors you already have**, and for
**adding the ones you meet in person**. A general contractor gets a roster
they control, documents that stay current, availability they can see, and a
QR code they hand to somebody on a job site.

**It is not a discovery engine, a directory, or a marketplace.** Nobody comes
here to browse for a roofer. There is no "find contractors near me", no
ranked list of companies a stranger can page through, and no feature that
answers "who is on SubSub?".

This is a product decision, not a missing feature. Read it as a standing
constraint on everything built here.

## The rule that follows from it

**No account may mine another account's subcontractors.**

Contractor names, contacts, phone numbers, addresses, documents, crews,
availability, rates and job history belong to the contractor and to the
accounts they have chosen to work with. Nothing built here may let anybody
else accumulate them.

Concretely, when adding or changing anything that reads the `companies`
table or anything hanging off it:

- **Scope to the caller's own engagements by default.** A query that reads
  company data and does not join `engagements` on the caller's `account_id`
  needs a specific reason, written down next to it.

- **Whole values only, never prefixes.** The connect lookup matches a
  complete email, a complete mobile or a complete licence number. No `LIKE`,
  no partial match, no "starts with", no fuzzy search across the table.
  A prefix search is a directory somebody can walk one letter at a time.

- **Answer the question, do not describe the company.** A lookup exists so
  you do not invite somebody who already has an account. It returns which
  company it is, so you ask the right one to connect — not their staff's
  names, not their licence number, not anything a caller with no
  relationship to them has a reason to hold.

- **Name matching is local only.** Matching a typed company name against the
  account's *own* contractors and its *own* outstanding invites is fine:
  that is its own data. Sending a name to the server to be matched across
  every company is not, and there is no endpoint that does it.

- **Rate-limit every lookup, per account.** Even whole-value matching is a
  confirm-and-enrich oracle for somebody holding a list of addresses.

- **A person's photograph is not a company logo.** Logos are public because
  they render on a login page. Avatars, documents and anything else about a
  person sit behind auth and behind a shared-account check.

- **Staff routes are staff routes.** `/api/platform/*` may read across every
  account because SubSub's own console needs to. It is gated by
  `requireStaff`. Never reach for one of those queries to serve a customer
  screen.

If a request seems to want a directory — "search all contractors", "show
similar companies nearby", "suggest subs for this trade" — stop and say so
before building it. It may still be the right thing to build, but it changes
what this product is and needs a decision, not an implementation.

## Decisions already made

These were settled deliberately. Changing one is a product decision, not a
refactor.

- **No state is hardcoded.** `app/shared/states.js` is the one list — fifty
  states and DC — imported by the Worker and the browser, with a hand copy in
  `get-started.html` (no build step there) that a test keeps in step.
  Territories are absent on purpose. No form defaults to a state and no
  placeholder names one: a pre-filled wrong answer is worse than an empty
  box.

- **Signing up never requires a licence, a UBI or a document.** Several
  states have no state contractor licence at all, so it was a question a real
  general contractor could not answer, and it cost signups for nothing.
  Credentials are asked for **inside the account**, in the set-up checklist,
  where they buy something: being hireable, and later being eligible for work
  passed on by other accounts. "Add one myself" is the exception — there the
  hiring account is typing the record and has the card in front of them.

- **Gate at value delivery, not at the door.** Anything that asks a user for
  paperwork belongs at the moment the paperwork earns them something.

- **Documents carry carrier, policy number, coverage amount and expiry.** An
  expired certificate that still shows as approved is worse than a missing
  one. An expiry that lapses under an already-scheduled job does **not**
  block it — it raises an urgent request for a replacement.

  `app/shared/docs.js` is the status logic. Two rules there are load-bearing:
  **a blank expiry means "does not expire", never "unknown"** — a W-9 and a
  signed contract have no shelf life, and treating a missing date as doubt
  would put two thirds of every roster permanently amber until people learned
  to ignore the colour. And **the date that matters is the job's, not
  today's**: a certificate current now but lapsing Friday does not cover work
  booked for the Tuesday after, and assignment is the only moment anybody can
  act on that. Each upload is a row in `company_docs` and old ones are
  superseded rather than deleted, because the question in a dispute is "were
  they insured on the day of that job".

- **Completion is two-party and append-only.** The subcontractor marks work
  reached with evidence; an admin **or project manager** verifies it. Neither
  side can do both. Completion is an event log, not a status flag, because
  payment releases will depend on it and "who said this was done, and what
  did they show?" has to be answerable months later. Photos are nudged, never
  required.

- **Money is whole cents and every cut is cumulative.** `app/shared/money.js`
  is the arithmetic; nothing computes a percentage of money anywhere else. A
  rate rounded per release drifts — 5% of three $333.33 milestones is not 5%
  of $1,000 — so each cut is *what should have been taken by now, minus what
  was taken before*. Basis points, never floats, never a stored figure that
  could be derived from two others.

- **The ledger is written for a processor that does not exist yet.**
  `wo_releases.method` and `.reference` are the seam: today a cheque number
  typed in, later a transfer id, with nothing else changing shape. The fee
  rate is stamped onto each release at the moment it is made, so changing the
  rate next year cannot rewrite what was charged last year — it is zero until
  payment processing ships, which is the point of having the column from the
  first row.

- **Why a GC would route payment through SubSub**, for anything customer-
  facing: the transfer is not the product. Releasing and signing the lien
  waiver as one event, refusing to pay a subcontractor whose insurance
  lapsed, paying against verified work rather than a text message, retainage
  that does not leak, and 1099s that are generated rather than reconstructed.
  The bank moves money for free; what is being bought is the reason to let
  it go.

- **A lien waiver is a chain, and it rolls up as a status.** A waiver binds
  only the party that signs it, so one from your subcontractor does nothing
  about the supply house they still owe. The useful object is the chain:
  same row shape at every tier, a parent pointer, and a roll-up that is a
  **count and a date, never a list** — an account may know their
  subcontractor's chain is clear; they may not have that subcontractor's
  supplier list, which is their sources and by inference their margins.
  Nothing is ever "clear", only "clear through a date", because material
  delivered the next morning is not covered.

  Very often there is no chain at all: the hiring account buys the supplies
  and the subcontractor is labour. That is `scope_kind = 'labor_only'`, a
  declaration somebody signs rather than an absence nobody recorded — and it
  moves the exposure *up*, because then it is the hiring account's own supply
  house that can lien the owner.

  **SubSub authors no waiver document.** It requests, tracks, gates payment
  on, and stores what was signed with a hash of it. Generating the text is a
  separate decision with a lawyer attached: roughly a dozen states prescribe
  exact wording and a form that deviates can be void, and lien law follows
  the property's state, not the signer's.

- **Overflow is broadcast, not browse.** When an account has nobody on its
  own roster for an urgent job, it may broadcast to opted-in companies —
  general contractors included, since 031 made every one of them hireable.
  The posting account never sees a list of candidates, only the ones who
  answer. No ranking, no profiles, no enumeration. Eligibility is earned:
  good ratings, three months on SubSub, a minimum number of completed jobs,
  current documents and a verified licence. It is free at launch and will
  charge a percentage of job value once payment processing exists — so the
  fee is modelled from the start and switched off, not bolted on later.

  This is the one exception to "not a directory", and it stays an exception
  because nothing about it is browsable.

## Working here

- The app is `app/` (Vite + React, one large `App.tsx`), the API is
  `app/worker/index.js` (Hono on Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2), and the
  marketing site is at the repo root.
- Migrations are applied **by hand** in the D1 console, in order. Every one
  that adds a column or table gets a line in
  `app/worker/migrations/CHECK.sql`, which answers "did I run that one?"
  against the schema itself.
- D1 stops a multi-statement script at the first failing statement and does
  not undo what ran before it. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` is the statement
  that is not repeatable, so it goes in a paste of its own.
- Tests live in `app/scripts/*-test.mjs` and are registered in
  `package.json`. The ones ending in a browser harness build the real bundle
  and stub the API (`scripts/lib/stub-stack.mjs`) — no worker, no database.
- Before claiming a fix works, revert it and confirm the test fails.
