# SubSub

## What this is, and what it is not

SubSub is for **running the subcontractors you already have**, and for
**adding the ones you meet in person**. A general contractor gets a roster
they control, documents that stay current, availability they can see, and a
QR code they hand to somebody on a job site.

**It is not a discovery engine, a directory, or a marketplace.** Nobody comes
here to browse for a roofer. There is no "find contractors near me", no
ranked list of companies a stranger can page through, and no feature that
answers "who is on SubSub?".

This is a product decision, not a missing feature. Read it as a standing
constraint on everything built here.

## The rule that follows from it

**No account may mine another account's subcontractors.**

Contractor names, contacts, phone numbers, addresses, documents, crews,
availability, rates and job history belong to the contractor and to the
accounts they have chosen to work with. Nothing built here may let anybody
else accumulate them.

Concretely, when adding or changing anything that reads the `companies`
table or anything hanging off it:

- **Scope to the caller's own engagements by default.** A query that reads
  company data and does not join `engagements` on the caller's `account_id`
  needs a specific reason, written down next to it.

- **Whole values only, never prefixes.** The connect lookup matches a
  complete email, a complete mobile or a complete licence number. No `LIKE`,
  no partial match, no "starts with", no fuzzy search across the table.
  A prefix search is a directory somebody can walk one letter at a time.

- **Answer the question, do not describe the company.** A lookup exists so
  you do not invite somebody who already has an account. It returns which
  company it is, so you ask the right one to connect — not their staff's
  names, not their licence number, not anything a caller with no
  relationship to them has a reason to hold.

- **Name matching is local only.** Matching a typed company name against the
  account's *own* contractors and its *own* outstanding invites is fine:
  that is its own data. Sending a name to the server to be matched across
  every company is not, and there is no endpoint that does it.

- **Rate-limit every lookup, per account.** Even whole-value matching is a
  confirm-and-enrich oracle for somebody holding a list of addresses.

- **A person's photograph is not a company logo.** Logos are public because
  they render on a login page. Avatars, documents and anything else about a
  person sit behind auth and behind a shared-account check.

- **Staff routes are staff routes.** `/api/platform/*` may read across every
  account because SubSub's own console needs to. It is gated by
  `requireStaff`. Never reach for one of those queries to serve a customer
  screen.

If a request seems to want a directory — "search all contractors", "show
similar companies nearby", "suggest subs for this trade" — stop and say so
before building it. It may still be the right thing to build, but it changes
what this product is and needs a decision, not an implementation.

## Decisions already made

These were settled deliberately. Changing one is a product decision, not a
refactor.

- **No state is hardcoded.** `app/shared/states.js` is the one list — fifty
  states and DC — imported by the Worker and the browser, with a hand copy in
  `get-started.html` (no build step there) that a test keeps in step.
  Territories are absent on purpose. No form defaults to a state and no
  placeholder names one: a pre-filled wrong answer is worse than an empty
  box.

- **Signing up never requires a licence, a UBI or a document.** Several
  states have no state contractor licence at all, so it was a question a real
  general contractor could not answer, and it cost signups for nothing.
  Credentials are asked for **inside the account**, in the set-up checklist,
  where they buy something: being hireable, and later being eligible for work
  passed on by other accounts. "Add one myself" is the exception — there the
  hiring account is typing the record and has the card in front of them.

- **Gate at value delivery, not at the door.** Anything that asks a user for
  paperwork belongs at the moment the paperwork earns them something.

- **Documents carry carrier, policy number, coverage amount and expiry.** An
  expired certificate that still shows as approved is worse than a missing
  one. An expiry that lapses under an already-scheduled job does **not**
  block it — it raises an urgent request for a replacement.

  `app/shared/docs.js` is the status logic. Two rules there are load-bearing:
  **a blank expiry means "does not expire", never "unknown"** — a W-9 and a
  signed contract have no shelf life, and treating a missing date as doubt
  would put two thirds of every roster permanently amber until people learned
  to ignore the colour. And **the date that matters is the job's, not
  today's**: a certificate current now but lapsing Friday does not cover work
  booked for the Tuesday after, and assignment is the only moment anybody can
  act on that. Each upload is a row in `company_docs` and old ones are
  superseded rather than deleted, because the question in a dispute is "were
  they insured on the day of that job".

- **Auto-schedule is granted, not assigned.** An auto-scheduled job is
  written to the subcontractor's calendar as *accepted*, with no response
  window and no accept/decline buttons in their portal. That is a commitment,
  so the side paying for the work cannot switch it on for the side doing it.
  `app/shared/autoschedule.js` holds the rule and the API enforces it; the
  hiring side may ask, by email, and may always switch it **off** — taking it
  away costs a round trip and binds nobody.

  The one case where the hiring account sets it directly is a contractor with
  **no portal**: a record the account typed in, with no seat here and no
  SubSub account of their own. Nobody is going to press accept, so the
  response window just expires; turning it on is the account declining to
  wait for a reply that was never coming, not a promise extracted from
  anybody. The test for "is there somebody to ask?" is scoped to *this*
  account — a seat on some other account cannot reach this engagement's
  switch, so counting it would leave the flag settable by nobody at all.

- **A building can change hands, and it takes both parties.** A building owner
  invited onto their property manager's account is a guest there. Until 039,
  firing the manager cost them the building, its job history, its certificates
  and their own view of all three — and they could not even let themselves out,
  because the person they were leaving held the only button. That is the wrong
  answer to "what happens to my building if I change agent", and it is the same
  question a manager asks before putting a portfolio in here.

  `properties.account_id` now means **who operates it**; `owner_account_id`
  means **who owns it**. For every row that existed before 039 they are equal,
  which is the truthful backfill. `app/shared/handover.js` holds the rules.

  **Two-party, always.** One side asks, the other agrees, and the side that
  asked has already agreed by asking — so it is always the *other* side that
  decides. That rule reads the **requesting account off the row**, never from
  which side is "the owner": on a handover the owner is the `to` side, on an
  appointment they are the `from` side, so any rule phrased in owner/manager
  terms points at the requester for one of the two and moves a building on one
  signature. Note also that an owner asking is signed in to their *seat* on the
  manager's account, so the account a request arrives through is not the party
  making it.

  **The jobs do not move.** `jobs.account_id` is untouched, so the outgoing
  manager keeps every job they ran without anything being copied, and the owner
  reads their building's whole history across however many managers it has had
  (`GET /api/properties/:id/history`). Nothing is deleted to satisfy a departing
  client — a job the manager ran is a job the manager may later be asked to
  account for.

  **The roster does not move.** A manager's contractors are their own
  relationships. Only the building's *scoping* of them is cleared; the
  engagements stay. Handing a departing client their ex-manager's book is the
  accumulation this product refuses everywhere else.

  **Tenants follow the building**, because a tenant is a person who reports a
  leak at that address and their next report has to reach whoever manages it.
  Their seat, their unit and their property scope all move.

  And **a tenant keeps their own reports** across the move. Jobs never move, so
  without this a tenant who followed their building lost every report they had
  ever made about their own home — nothing on the new account, and a 403 from
  the old one, because their seat there is gone. Their own reports about their
  own home are the most personal record here and the least defensible thing to
  lose. Scoped hard: reported **by them**, at a property they are **still** a
  tenant of, read-only, with the account that handled it named — because "who
  did I report this to" is what somebody chasing an old repair is asking. Not
  the building's other repairs: sharing an address with somebody is not a reason
  to read their business.

  **An owner keeps watching a building they appointed out.** The property stays
  on their list *and* the work at it comes with them — `/api/properties` and
  `/api/jobs` both return rows for buildings the caller owns but does not
  operate, marked `ownedNotOperated` / `atOwnedProperty` and `readOnly`. Without
  the second half an owner sees a name, an address and nothing ever happening at
  it, which is being shown a card rather than seeing their building — and
  watching the property is the entire reason they are here. Every action on such
  a job is gated in one place, not per button. A guest seat never reaches any of
  it: an owner or tenant scoped to named buildings sees what that scope allows
  and nothing through a second door, including when their *host* account owns an
  appointed-out building.

  **And they may ask for work at it.** Watching is not enough on its own: an
  owner sees their own building, hears the boiler, and has no seat on the
  account that runs it, so the ordinary owner request is closed to them and the
  only remaining move is the telephone. `POST /api/jobs` therefore accepts a
  property the caller **owns but does not operate**, and writes the job to the
  **operating** account as a request — `jobs.account_id` is the manager's,
  `requested_by` is the owner, nothing is approved, and no work order can be
  issued until the manager approves it. Both feeds record it, because each side
  needs its own record of who asked. The manager is told **who** asked by name
  on the row: the person is not a member of their account, so their own users
  list will never name them, and "somebody asked for work" is not something
  anybody can act on. The property is the only thing that decides whose account
  the work lands on, and a building the caller neither owns nor operates gives
  the same `property_not_found` as one that does not exist. Scoped seats are
  unaffected — a guest still cannot reach past its own buildings.

  **And urgency is not a way round the approval.** `dispatchEmergency` approves
  the job and issues a work order against *the account's own* emergency
  contractor, so run on the owner's side of a cross-account request it would
  approve the manager's job from outside and engage the **owner's** contractor
  on it. A cross-account request therefore never auto-dispatches; the urgency is
  recorded for the manager, who holds the contractor, the money and the
  decision. Anything that later dispatches from a request has to answer the same
  question: whose account is the work on, and whose contractor is being spent?

  On the screen, what the form says follows **the building, not the role**. The
  owner is an admin of their own account, so the role says "create a job and
  find contractors" — a screen they will never be given for a building somebody
  else runs. So the form reads *Request work*, names the manager, and sends
  rather than creates; the picker marks which buildings are somebody else's to
  run before anything is sent. For the same reason, managing the *account* is
  not managing *that building*: the vendor affordances on such a card are gone,
  because scoping our contractor to their building answers a question that is
  not ours to ask.

  **Open repairs survive the move, without moving.** A building can change hands
  with a repair half done, and because jobs do not move the incoming manager saw
  *nothing*: no sign a contractor was due Tuesday, nobody to let them in, nobody
  to verify the work, and a tenant waiting on a leak the new manager had never
  heard of. The contractor turns up at a building whose manager has no record of
  them. That is the worst moment this product can produce and it happened
  silently.

  The answer is not to move the jobs — the outgoing manager issued the work
  order, owes the money, and is the party the contractor has an agreement with,
  and moving them would hand a departing client their ex-manager's book. So the
  incoming operator gets the **roll-up shape**: `inheritedShape` in
  `app/shared/handover.js` passes what is wrong with the building and when
  somebody is due, and withholds the company, the price, the crew and the work
  order number. A count, a trade and a date — the same line the waiver roll-up
  draws, for the same reason. No new column: a job is inherited when this
  account operates the property, the job sits on another account, and it is not
  finished, so it drops off by itself when the previous manager closes it out.

  This is deliberately *stricter* than what an **owner** sees of work at a
  building they appointed out, and the two must not be harmonised. The owner is
  the client: the contractor is working on their building and they may know who.
  The incoming manager is a rival firm, and a portfolio handover would hand them
  every contractor on it. Same read-only shape, different redaction, for a
  reason.

  `assignments` on that shape is **empty, not absent**. Every screen assumes a
  job has one (`j.trades.filter((t) => j.assignments[t])` in a dozen places) and
  handing them a job without it white-screened the jobs list. Empty is also the
  honest answer: this account has assigned nobody.

  Both sides are **told at the moment of transfer**, on the decision panel and
  in both feeds — silence there is exactly how a repair gets dropped between two
  companies that each assumed the other had it. It never *blocks* the transfer:
  a repair going nowhere is very often why somebody is changing agent, and
  refusing to release a building until the work is finished hands the outgoing
  manager a hostage.

  Two things this uncovered, both live before it. The panel promised that
  "its jobs ... become yours to run", which is the one thing a handover never
  does. And `canComplete` answers "may this **role** complete jobs", not "may
  they complete **this** job", so *Mark job complete* was offered on work
  another account was running — an owner could close out their manager's repair.
  Read-only means read-only, and the gate belongs with the other one, on
  `j.readOnly`.

  An owner then holding their building may **appoint** a manager — the same
  two-party rule in reverse, and the manager must accept, because a building
  appearing in a portfolio unannounced is work, liability and possibly a plan
  limit. An appointment moves **operation only**, so the owner never loses the
  right to move their building again.

  **Appointing is the owner's move, and the columns cannot say so on their own.**
  The API always checked ownership — but 039 backfilled
  `owner_account_id = account_id` for every row that already existed, which was
  the only safe backfill and also means every building a managing agent had
  typed in reads as theirs. So the ownership check waved an agent through to
  appoint a *client's* building onward. The missing distinction is already
  modelled in `ACCOUNT_KINDS`: a property manager's account **invites** owners,
  because somebody else owns the buildings; a building owner's account has none
  to invite, because they *are* the owner. `canAppoint` in
  `app/shared/handover.js` therefore also asks whether this **kind** of account
  is the owner or acts for one, and the API and the screen both read it.

  An agent is not stuck, and the screen says so rather than going blank: they
  add the owner, the owner takes the building (two-party, as ever), and the
  owner appoints whoever they like. That is the chain working, rather than an
  agent sub-contracting an instruction that was never theirs to move.

  **And a firm that really does own a building says so.** Account kind closed
  the backfill hole and closed it on a real case too: a management firm owning
  a building of its own. No reading of the columns separates that from a
  client's building, because 039 wrote the same value for both — so 040 adds a
  **declaration**, `properties.owner_declared_at` and `.owner_declared_by`. The
  same shape as `scope_kind = 'labor_only'`: something somebody says out loud,
  with a name and a date against it, rather than an absence nobody recorded.

  Three properties hold it in place. It is **per building**, never per account,
  or a firm with two hundred client buildings and two of its own would unlock
  all two hundred and two by declaring one. It **never outranks ownership** —
  `canAppoint` checks who owns the building first, so a declaration cannot be
  used to claim somebody else's, and one left on a row whose owner later changes
  stops counting. And it is **reversible**, because a claim somebody mis-tapped
  should cost nothing to withdraw. Declaring and withdrawing both write to the
  event log and the feed: claiming a building as your own firm's is the sort of
  thing that gets asked about later.

  **The two sides of a transfer get different counts of open work**, and they
  only coincide when there has been exactly one previous manager. What the
  outgoing side is told is *their own* open work — "1 stays yours to finish" —
  because the repairs a manager before them left are not theirs to chase. What
  the incoming side is told is every open repair at the building that will not
  be theirs, leftovers from earlier managers included, because that is what they
  are actually taking on. An earlier version answered both with the outgoing
  side's number for the sake of a matching figure, and quietly told somebody
  appointed to a building with two managers' leftovers about one of them. The manager is named by **whole
  subdomain**, and an unknown one and a real account that cannot manage
  buildings give the **same answer**, so this cannot be walked to find out who
  is on SubSub.

- **A portfolio is scanned, so the property tile carries only what you scan
  for.** Every card used to hold the vendor chips, the owners panel with its
  invite chasing, the whole handover conversation, the notes and four buttons, in
  330px columns. Eight buildings were several screens, and the question a
  portfolio is opened to answer — which of these needs me — was below the fold on
  card two. The tile is now the name, the address, who runs it when that is
  somebody else, and the counts; `.prop-detail` in a wide modal holds the rest.
  Roughly 97px and four to a row where it was 220px and three.

  **The counts stay on the tile and stay followable.** "Five open jobs" with
  nowhere to go was the original complaint about this screen, and burying the
  numbers a tap deeper to make room would have undone that fix to pay for this
  one. The name is the way in rather than the whole tile, because a button inside
  a button is not a thing and the counts have to keep working as buttons.

  The detail panel reads the property **out of props on every render**, not from
  the row it was opened with. Editing, adding an owner or answering a handover
  from inside it changes that row, and a panel still showing its opening copy is
  the stale-snapshot bug this file has grown twice before.

- **The side being asked may see who is asking.** Accept and Decline with
  nothing but a name is a decision made blind: the card says these people will
  be able to send you work orders and read your compliance documents, and gave
  no way at all to find out who they are. So a pending connect request opens a
  profile of the **asking** account.

  This is not the directory this product refuses, and the difference is
  structural rather than a matter of care. The route is keyed by the
  **request**, never by an account, so there is no endpoint that takes an
  account id and describes it and nothing to walk. It answers only the company
  the request was addressed to, and only while the request is still **pending**
  — a declined one is finished business and an accepted one means they are
  already working together. And it is **counts and areas, never lists**: how
  many buildings and which towns, never an address; how much work has gone
  through, never which jobs. Their contractor roster is not in it at all, and
  not as a count either — that is their book, and it tells the answering side
  nothing about whether to say yes.

  The principle is the one overflow already runs on: answering a post makes you
  known to the account that posted it, because you chose to answer. Asking to
  connect makes you known to the account you asked, for the same reason and for
  exactly as long as the question is open.

- **A two-party handshake has to be visible to the second party.** Since 031
  an account is a company too, so a hiring account can ask *another account* to
  connect. The request was written, the asking side showed "waiting on their
  answer", and the answering side showed nothing: the only screen rendering it
  was Account → Company, and the amber badge that would have pointed at it sits
  in the contractor portal's nav, inside `can("portal")` — which `ROLES.admin`
  does not include. So a request sat pending forever with nobody able to find
  it. The API was right the whole time; `/api/my-connect-requests` answers an
  admin seat correctly, and `companyHasLogin` already refuses to create a
  request nobody could answer.

  It is on the **dashboard** now, above "Waiting on contractors" — its exact
  mirror, one being who we are waiting on and the other who is waiting on us —
  with the count badged on the nav so it is findable from anywhere. The general
  rule this is an instance of: **whenever one side of a handshake is told it is
  waiting on somebody, find the screen where that somebody answers, and check a
  seat that role actually has.** Connect, handover, completion, overflow and job
  approval are all this shape, and the badge living behind a capability the
  answering role lacks is a silent way to break any of them.

- **Completion is two-party and append-only.** The subcontractor marks work
  reached with evidence; an admin **or project manager** verifies it. Neither
  side can do both. Completion is an event log, not a status flag, because
  payment releases will depend on it and "who said this was done, and what
  did they show?" has to be answerable months later. Photos are nudged, never
  required.

- **Money is whole cents and every cut is cumulative.** `app/shared/money.js`
  is the arithmetic; nothing computes a percentage of money anywhere else. A
  rate rounded per release drifts — 5% of three $333.33 milestones is not 5%
  of $1,000 — so each cut is *what should have been taken by now, minus what
  was taken before*. Basis points, never floats, never a stored figure that
  could be derived from two others.

- **The ledger is written for a processor that does not exist yet.**
  `wo_releases.method` and `.reference` are the seam: today a cheque number
  typed in, later a transfer id, with nothing else changing shape. The fee
  rate is stamped onto each release at the moment it is made, so changing the
  rate next year cannot rewrite what was charged last year — it is zero until
  payment processing ships, which is the point of having the column from the
  first row.

- **Why a GC would route payment through SubSub**, for anything customer-
  facing: the transfer is not the product. Releasing and signing the lien
  waiver as one event, refusing to pay a subcontractor whose insurance
  lapsed, paying against verified work rather than a text message, retainage
  that does not leak, and 1099s that are generated rather than reconstructed.
  The bank moves money for free; what is being bought is the reason to let
  it go.

- **A lien waiver is a chain, and it rolls up as a status.** A waiver binds
  only the party that signs it, so one from your subcontractor does nothing
  about the supply house they still owe. The useful object is the chain:
  same row shape at every tier, a parent pointer, and a roll-up that is a
  **count and a date, never a list** — an account may know their
  subcontractor's chain is clear; they may not have that subcontractor's
  supplier list, which is their sources and by inference their margins.
  Nothing is ever "clear", only "clear through a date", because material
  delivered the next morning is not covered.

  Very often there is no chain at all: the hiring account buys the supplies
  and the subcontractor is labour. That is `scope_kind = 'labor_only'`, a
  declaration somebody signs rather than an absence nobody recorded — and it
  moves the exposure *up*, because then it is the hiring account's own supply
  house that can lien the owner.

  **SubSub authors no waiver document.** It requests, tracks, gates payment
  on, and stores what was signed with a hash of it. Generating the text is a
  separate decision with a lawyer attached: roughly a dozen states prescribe
  exact wording and a form that deviates can be void, and lien law follows
  the property's state, not the signer's.

- **A subcontractor may send their own paperwork, and that is the growth
  loop.** Every other way into SubSub needs the hiring side to already be here:
  they look a contractor up, or they scan a code, and both need an account
  first. So supply could never bring demand in — which, in a product with no
  directory, is the only flywheel available.

  A subcontractor is asked for the same four documents several times a month,
  nearly always by a general contractor who is not on SubSub, and answers by
  attaching PDFs that start going stale the moment they are sent. `POST
  /api/doc-shares` is that same act done once: they type the address of
  somebody who just asked, and that person gets a page with the carrier, the
  policy number, the coverage and — the part an attachment can never do — the
  expiry, live. Migration 041 holds `doc_shares`; `app/shared/docshare.js`
  holds the rules.

  **The W-9 is not in the link.** It carries a TIN, and for a sole proprietor
  that is their social security number; email gets forwarded, sits in shared
  inboxes and turns up in the archive of whoever leaves next year. The page
  says a W-9 is on file and reading it needs an account. That is the one piece
  of deliberate friction in the flow, placed where the recipient is already
  getting the thing they asked for. Changing it is a decision about somebody
  else's identity documents, not a tweak to a share feature.

  **The link is not a public URL.** One 32-byte random token per recipient,
  never derived from anything about the company or the clock, expiring in
  `SHARE_DAYS`, revocable, and replaced rather than duplicated when the same
  address is sent to twice. The file route is pinned three ways: the token
  names the share, the share names the company, and the document must be a
  current row of *that* company of a kind the link may carry.

  This is the one addition to the public-route exemption list that serves a
  compliance document, and the comment there now carries both halves. The rule
  it does not break is the real one: a route that serves a document by an
  account or company id serves it to anybody who can guess an id. Nothing here
  is addressable by an id.

  **A connection has two ends and only one was ever drawn.** Accepting a
  request writes an engagement on the *other* account and seats this team over
  there — so the hiring side gains a contractor and this side gains nothing it
  can see. Every engagement read in the Worker is `account_id = mine`, which is
  "the contractors I hire"; nothing read `company_id = mine`, which is "the
  accounts that hire me". So a general contractor who said yes to a property
  manager could find them in the account switcher and nowhere else, and had no
  answer at all to "who do we work for". `GET /api/clients` is that list, on
  the Contractors screen above the roster: the list below is who works for us
  and this is who we work for. Nothing new crosses — these accounts chose to
  engage this company and this company's people already hold a seat in each of
  them. What it adds is the sentence, not the access.

  **And a hireable account needs somewhere to keep its own paperwork.** Since
  031 an account is a company, so it can be asked for the same four documents
  as any subcontractor — but uploading one lived only in the contractor portal,
  behind `can("portal")`, which `ROLES.admin` does not include. An account that
  could be hired therefore had nowhere to put a certificate and nothing to
  send. Both now sit in Account → Company beside the hireable profile, which is
  where being hireable already lives. This is the same root as the connect
  badge, and it is worth stating as a rule: **anything 031 made true of an
  account-as-company has to have a home outside the contractor portal**, because
  the seat that runs an account never has one.

  **Sending is gated on a document being uploaded, not verified.** Verification
  is each hiring account's own verdict and says nothing about whether the
  contractor has one to send — the common case is that they upload and somebody
  else asks before the first account has reviewed it. The server and the screen
  both gate on presence, and they must not disagree.

- **Overflow is broadcast, not browse.** When an account has nobody on its
  own roster for an urgent job, it may broadcast to opted-in companies —
  general contractors included, since 031 made every one of them hireable.
  The posting account never sees a list of candidates, only the ones who
  answer. No ranking, no profiles, no enumeration. Eligibility is earned:
  good ratings, three months on SubSub, a minimum number of completed jobs,
  current documents and a verified licence. **Three months on SubSub means
  since they joined, not since they opted in** — the earliest of their own
  account being created and the first time anybody engaged them. Counting from
  the opt-in made a subcontractor who had worked through SubSub for a year
  "too new" for a quarter, and since nobody had opted in before the feature
  shipped it meant a broadcast could reach nobody at all for three months. It is free at launch and will
  charge a percentage of job value once payment processing exists — so the
  fee is modelled from the start and switched off, not bolted on later.

  `app/shared/overflow.js` holds the eligibility rules and the fee model;
  migration 038 holds the tables. Three properties are load-bearing and easy
  to destroy by accident:

  **The posting account never learns who it went to.** `overflow_invites` is
  the distribution list and is server-side only — no route returns it,
  filtered or counted. A count of how many companies were asked measures the
  platform's roster, and an account that can watch that number move learns
  the shape of everybody else's business one post at a time. What an account
  reads is `overflow_responses`: the ones who answered, who by answering
  chose to be known to them.

  **There is no endpoint that takes a trade and returns companies.** Matching
  happens in the Worker and the answer is never returned.

  **It is refused when the account has somebody of their own** who covers the
  trade and could actually be issued the work. Without that precondition this
  is a marketplace with extra steps.

  A response is an offer, not a booking: picking is what creates the
  engagement and the work order, so overflow is how two accounts met rather
  than a different kind of relationship — every document and expiry check
  applies to it unchanged.

  This is the one exception to "not a directory", and it stays an exception
  because nothing about it is browsable.

## Working here

- The app is `app/` (Vite + React, one large `App.tsx`), the API is
  `app/worker/index.js` (Hono on Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2), and the
  marketing site is at the repo root.
- Migrations are applied **by hand** in the D1 console, in order. Every one
  that adds a column or table gets a line in
  `app/worker/migrations/CHECK.sql`, which answers "did I run that one?"
  against the schema itself.
- D1 stops a multi-statement script at the first failing statement and does
  not undo what ran before it. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` is the statement
  that is not repeatable, so it goes in a paste of its own.
- Tests live in `app/scripts/*-test.mjs` and are registered in
  `package.json`. The ones ending in a browser harness build the real bundle
  and stub the API (`scripts/lib/stub-stack.mjs`) — no worker, no database.
- Before claiming a fix works, revert it and confirm the test fails.
